<h3>Celestial coordinates</h3>
<p>
  Celestial Coordinates are the set of values that, according to a given
  reference system, give the position of an object on the celestial sphere.
  There are different celestial Coordinates depending on their origin and plane
  reference.

<h3 id="title1">Basic concepts</h3>
<h3 class="titlestab1">What is latitude?</h3>
<p>It is the angle between the parallel of a point and the quator.</p>

<h3 class="titlestab1">Latitude of Medellín</h3>
<p>
  Medellín is located in the geographic center of the Aburrá Valley, on the
  central mountain range of the Andes, at coordinates 6°13′55″N 75°34′05″W).
</p>

<h3 class="titlestab1">What is longitude?</h3>
<p>
  It is the angle between the meridian of a point and the zero meridian
  (Greenwich). Right ascension and declination coordinates define a coordinate
  system on the celestial sphere.
</p>

<h3 class="titlestab1">Earth meridians</h3>
<p>
  These are the maximum imaginary semicircles of the globe that pass through the
  north and south poles. By extension, they are also the maximum semicircles
  that pass through the poles of any sphere or spheroid of reference. They are
  imaginary lines which main utility is to determine the position (Longitude) of
  any place on Earth with respect to a reference meridian or meridian 0, adding
  the Latitude, determined by the parallel that passes through that point.

<h3 class="titlestab1">Equatorial parallel</h3>
<p>
  The Earth's equator, also called the equator line or 0° parallel, is the great
  circle perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the planet Earth.1 Like any
  great circle, it defines a plane passing through the center. It divides the
  planet into northern and southern hemispheres and is located at the same
  distance from the geographic poles. By definition, the latitude of the Earth's
  equator is 0°. The equatorial radius is 6378.1 km and the corresponding
  circumference is 40 075 km.

<h3 id="typesofcelestial">Types of celestial coordinates</h3>
<h3 class="titlestab1">Plane of the ecliptic</h3>
<p>
  The ecliptic coordinate system uses the ecliptic as the fundamental plane. The
  ecliptic is the path that the Sun appears to follow across the sky over the
  course of a year. It is also the projection of the Earth's orbital plane on
  the celestial sphere. The angle of latitude is called the ecliptic latitude,
  and the longitudinal angle is called the ecliptic longitude. Like the right
  ascension in the equatorial system, the zero point of ecliptic longitude is
  the vernal equinox.
</p>

<h3 class="titlestab1">The horizontal coordinate system</h3>
<p>
  Uses the observer's local horizon as the fundamental plane. This conveniently
  divides the sky into an upper hemisphere that can be seen, and a lower
  hemisphere that remains hidden (behind the Earth itself). The pole of the
  upper hemisphere is called the zenith, the pole of the lower hemisphere is
  called the nadir, the angle of an object above or below the horizon is called
  the elevation, the angle of an object around the horizon (measured from north,
  eastward) is called azimuth, the horizontal coordinate system is also known as
  the high azimuthal coordinate system.
</p>

<h3 class="titlestab1">Equatorial coordinate system</h3>
<p>
  Is probably the most widely used celestial coordinate system, it is also the
  one that most closely resembles the geographic coordinate system, since both
  use the same fundamental plane and the same poles. The projection of the
  Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere is called the celestial equator.
  Similarly, the projection of the geographic poles onto the celestial sphere
  defines the north and south celestial poles.

<h3 id="equageo">
  Difference between the equatorial and geographic coordinate systems
</h3>
<p>
  The latter is fixed to the Earth, and rotates with it, the equatorial system
  is fixed to the stars, so it seems to rotate through the sky along with them;
  but, of course, it is the Earth that rotates and the sky remains stationary.
  The celestial equator is an imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere.
  The celestial equator is the fundamental plane of the equatorial coordinate
  system, so it is defined as the locus of points with declination zero degrees.
  It is also the projection of the Earth's equator into the sky. <br></br> The celestial
  equator and the Ecliptic form an angle of 23.5 degrees in the sky, the points
  where they intersect are known as the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.
