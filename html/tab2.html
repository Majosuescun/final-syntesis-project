<h3>Equinox and solstice</h3>

<h3 id="equinoxx">Equinox</h3>
<p>
  The equinox is the time when day and night have equal length. It happens twice
  a year in each hemisphere, between March 20 and 21 and September 22 and 23, so
  the spring equinox and the autumn equinox are distinguished.
</p>
<h3 class="titlestab1">The vernal or spring equinox</h3>
<p>
  It occurs in the northern hemisphere in March, between the 20th and 21st, and
  in the southern hemisphere in September, between the 22nd and 23rd. It is
  related to the rebirth and the days begin to be longer. It marks the beginning
  of the season of growth and greening of nature.
