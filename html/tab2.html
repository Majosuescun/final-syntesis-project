<h3>Equinox and solstice</h3>
<img id="solsequi" src="images/solsequi.png" />
<h3 id="equinoxx">Equinox</h3>
<p>
  The equinox is the time when day and night have equal length. It happens twice
  a year in each hemisphere, between March 20 and 21 and September 22 and 23, so
  the spring equinox and the autumn equinox are distinguished.
</p>
<h3 class="titlestab1">The vernal or spring equinox</h3>
<p>
  It occurs in the northern hemisphere in March, between the 20th and 21st, and
  in the southern hemisphere in September, between the 22nd and 23rd. It is
  related to the rebirth and the days begin to be longer. It marks the beginning
  of the season of growth and greening of nature.
</p>

<h3 class="titlestab1">The autumnal equinox</h3>
<p>
  It occurs in the northern hemisphere between September 22nd and 23rd in
  countries such as Spain, Mexico, Canada, among others. In the southern
  hemisphere it occurs in March between March 21st and 22nd in countries such as
  Argentina, Chile, Australia, among others. It marks the withdrawal of the sun,
  i.e., it is noticeable that the days are shorter. It is characterized by the
  fall of leaves, the beginning of the coldest season of the year, the end of
  harvests, and the migration of birds.

<h3 class="titlestab1">Other characterisrics</h3>
<p>
  - When an equinox occurs, the sun is located just above the line of the
  Earth's equator. Therefore, the northern and southern hemispheres receive the
  same amount of sunlight and shade.<br> </br> - During the equinox the sun reaches the
  zenith, the highest point in the sky at an angle of 90° relative to an object
  on Earth. Thus the ecliptic, the curved line that the sun travels around the
  Earth, coincides with the celestial equator, whose axis of inclination is
  23.5° with respect to the ecliptic. <br> </br>  - All the planets of our solar system
  experience equinoxes with their own particular characteristics.

<h3 id="solstice">Solstice</h3>
<p>The solstice is the time of the year when there is the greatest difference in length between day and night. In one hemisphere of the planet, it is the longest day of the year, which marks the beginning of summer. At the same time, the opposite hemisphere has the longest night of the year, which marks the beginning of winter. <br> </br> This astronomical event occurs twice a year. The first solstice occurs around June 21, when the sun aligns with the tropic of Cancer (Cancer solstice). The second occurs around December 21, when the sun aligns with the Tropic of Capricorn (Capricorn Solstice). </p>

<h3 class="titlestab1">Summer solstice</h3>
<p>The longest day of the year and the shortest night are called summer solstice. This day marks the official beginning of the summer season. Depending on the hemisphere, the dates of the summer solstice are as follows: <br> </br> - Northern hemisphere: around June 21.
<br> </br> - Southern hemisphere: around December 21.
  </p>

  <h3 class="titlestab1">Winter solstice</h3>
  <p>The winter solstice is the longest night of the year and, therefore, the shortest day. It marks the beginning of winter. The dates of the winter solstice in each hemisphere are as follows: <br> </br> - Northern hemisphere: around December 21.
   <br> </br> - Southern hemisphere: around June 21.
    </p>

    <h3 class="titlestab1">Other characterisrics</h3>
    <p>-	During the Earth's translation around the sun, the distance of the equator from the sun peaks in June and December. At these times, the sun is closest to one of the tropics. In June, the sun approaches the tropic of Cancer, located in the northern hemisphere. In December, the sun approaches the Tropic of Capricorn, located in the southern hemisphere.<br> </br>
      -	Due to the geometry of the Earth and its motion around the sun, the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the winter solstice in the southern hemisphere and vice versa.

      <h3 id="whatis">What is the difference between equinoxes and solstices?</h3>
    <p>The solstice is the astronomical event in which the sun reaches its highest or lowest altitude in the sky. Consequently, one of the hemispheres receives more or less sun rays, it marks the beginning of summer with longer days and winter with shorter days. On the other hand, the equinox is the moment when night and day have the same length because the sun is over the Earth's equator. It also occurs in both hemispheres and marks the beginning of spring and autumn. Both equinoxes and solstices mark the seasons of the year.

      <h3 id="howis">How is the position of the earth related to the solstices and equinoxes?</h3>
<p>Each season is marked by the time when the Earth is in a certain position with respect to the sun. Solstices and equinoxes occur twice a year. The solstice marks the beginning of summer and winter, while the equinox marks the arrival of spring and summer.</p>
