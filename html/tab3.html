<h3>Megalithic structures</h3>
<p>
  Is a prehistoric monument made of large stones. The word Megalithic, comes
  from the Greek; "mega" meaning, large, and "lithos" meaning, stone. Megalithic
  structures can be found throughout Europe, Russia, the Americas, Africa and
  Asia. Even though they are very distant from each other.

<h3 id="typesmega">There are three types of megaliths</h3>
<h3 class="titlestab1">Menhir</h3>
<p>
  It consists of a large block of stone with an elongated shape and vertically
  nailed to the ground. It is believed that it could have been used to worship
  the sun or a deceased person of certain prestige in the village, or to mark a
  territorial extension.

<h3 class="titlestab1">Dolmen</h3>
<p>
  It makes reference to constructions of several vertical stones that support a
  horizontal one or to other more complex constructions that have a chamber and,
  in occasions, of a corridor through which one accedes to that main chamber.

<h3 class="titlestab1">Cr√≥mlech</h3>
<p>
  It is a group of menhirs and dolmens, whose distribution gives rise to a
  circular shape. They seem to be temples or sanctuaries related to the solar
  cult.

<h3 id="stonene">
  How were the megalithic structures of Stonehenge used in the past?
</h3>
<p>
  We can not be sure of all the functions that had the monument, but there is
  one that is very likely that it did have: to mark the solstices and equinoxes,
  in the recreation of the image above you can see without problems these
  astrological phenomena, so yes, it seems reasonable to say that Stonehenge
  was, among other things, an astronomical observatory. This is agreed upon by
  the experts and also by the thousands of tourists who throng to Salisbury
  every year.
